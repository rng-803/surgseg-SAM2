# SAM2 Surgical Segmentation Docs

This folder collects living design documents for the SAM 2 + tiny refiner pipeline. The authoritative roadmap lives in `../ROADMAP.md`; as code grows, add sub-docs here for:

- detailed dataset cards (splits, preprocessing quirks, augmentations)
- refiner architecture notes and ablations
- deployment runbooks (TensorRT build notes, server configs)
- QA/monitoring procedures and regression checklists

Please keep documents short, actionable, and tightly scoped so they can double as on-boarding material for new contributors.
